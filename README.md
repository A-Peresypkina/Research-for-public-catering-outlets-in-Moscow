# Research-for-public-catering-outlets-in-Moscow

Good day, this research was made while I was studying in Yandex.

**Purpose**: prepare a market research for public catering outlets in Moscow, find interesting features for choosing a suitable location for investors

**Stages**: 
1) data loading, EDA
2) study of correlation
3) conclusions

**Stack**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, folium

**Conclusions**:
1) Most coffees  are in the center. In other administrative districts, their number varies from 60 to 120 establishments;
2) Without taking into account the shopping center, there are 51 coffee shops in the dataset with 24-hour operation (the majority of 24-hour coffee shops are in the Central Administrative District (19 units), followed by the Closed Administrative District (9 units) and the South-Western Administrative District (7 units));
3) In general, the ratings of cafes are the same;
4) It was found that the South-Western Administrative District is the leader in the median cost of 1 cup of cappuccino, while the leader in the median cost of the average bill is yavl. ZAO, and South-Western Administrative Okrug does not fall into the top 3 in terms of price. In this case, the cost of an average cup of cappuccino is determined by the data from the column with the average bill. Additional research/verification is recommended.

**Recommendations for opening a new establishment**:
1) The cost of a standard cup of cappuccino is best kept in the range from 150 to 170 rubles (this price will be in the average price range);
2) Number of seats: 35-60 (since the goal: opening a coffee shop similar to the Central Coffee House in the TV series "Friends");
3) Recommended operating hours from 10 to 22 hours (there are not many 24-hour coffee shops, and coffee shops with seating are more likely for daytime and evening leisure);
4) Location: when looking for premises to rent, it is better to look at addresses near the borders of the Central Administrative District (within the third transport ring, best in the territory of the Western Administrative District, South-Western Administrative District, North-Western Administrative District)
